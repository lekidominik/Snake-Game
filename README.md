In this project, I am implementing the Snake game in C# using a WPF Application. During the implementation,
I focused on adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and aimed for a visually appealing solution.
I am using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 in this project and .NET 8.0.
If you want to try the game open it in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and you can launch it with the green triangle called snake.
